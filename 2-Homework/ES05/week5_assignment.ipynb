    "\r\n",
    "The core datatype of NumPy is the NumPy Array. NumPy Arrays build on the basic Python List datatype to add functionality for vector math and common statistical calculations. The easiest way to create a NumPy Array is to first create a List and then passing it as the argument to the *np.Array()* constructor. In this exercise, you'll create some NumPy arrays, and then perform some simple operations on them.\r\n",
