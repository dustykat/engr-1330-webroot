    "## Mendel's Pea Flowers\n",
    "\n",
    "Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) was an Austrian monk who is widely recognized as the founder of the modern field of genetics. Mendel performed careful and large-scale experiments on plants to come up with fundamental laws of genetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of his experiments were on varieties of pea plants. He formulated sets of assumptions about each variety; these were his models. He then tested the validity of his models by growing the plants and gathering data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze the data from one such experiment to see if Mendel's model was good.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a particular variety, each plant has either purple flowers or white. The color in each plant is unaffected by the colors in other plants. Mendel hypothesized that the plants should bear purple or white flowers at random, in the ratio 3:1.\n",
    "### Mendel's Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For every plant, there is a 75% chance that it will have purple flowers, and a 25% chance that the flowers will be white, regardless of the colors in all the other plants.\n",
    "Approach to Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "To go about assessing Mendel's model, we can simulate plants under the assumptions of the model and see what it predicts. Then we will be able to compare the predictions with the data that Mendel recorded.\n",
    "The Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to see whether or not Mendel's model is good. We need to simulate a statistic that will help us make this decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model is good, the percent of purple-flowering plants in the sample should be close to 75%. If the model is not good, the percent purple-flowering will be away from 75%. It may be higher, or lower; the direction doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key for us is the distance between 75% and the percent of purple-flowering plants in the sample. Big distances are evidence that the model isn't good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our statistic, therefore, is the distance between the sample percent and 75%:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$∣sample percent of purple-flowering plants−75∣$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicting the Statistic Under the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how big the distance would be if Mendel's model were true, we can use sample_proportions to simulate the distance under the assumptions of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have to figure out how many times to sample. To do this, remember that we are going to compare our simulation with Mendel's plants. So we should simulate the same number of plants that he had.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mendel grew a lot of plants. There were 929 plants of the variety corresponding to this model. So we have to sample 929 times.\n",
    "Generating One Value of the Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps in the calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sample 929 times at random from the distribution specified by the model and find the sample proportion in the purple-flowering category.\n",
    "    Multiply the proportion by 100 to get a pecent.\n",
    "    Subtract 75 and take the absolute value of the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the statistic: the distance between the sample percent and 75.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by defining a function that takes a proportion and returns the absolute difference between the corresponding percent and 75.\n"
