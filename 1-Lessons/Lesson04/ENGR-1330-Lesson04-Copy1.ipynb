The reliability is expressed as the fraction of time that no parts have failed, if the fraction is small we would want to either improve part reliability, or ensure redundancy so the system can function with broken parts.\n",

    "- `if` statement is true, then do ...\n",
    "- `if....else` statement is true, then do ..., otherwise do something else\n",
    "- `if....elif....else` statement is true, then do ..., if something else is true then do ..., otherwise do ... \n",

    "these results to perform further operations based on these conditions.\n",
    "All flow control in a program depends on evaluating conditions. The program will proceed\n",
    "diferently based on the outcome of one or more conditions - really sophisticated AI programs are a collection of conditions and correlations. \n",

    "It's spooky, but ultimately just a program running in the background trying to make your money theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common conditional operation is comparison. If we wish to compare whether two\n",
    "variables are the same we use the == (double equal sign).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example x == y means the program will ask whether x and y have the same value. \n",
    "If they do, the result is TRUE if not then the result is FALSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other comparison signs are `!=` does NOT equal, `<` smaller than, `> `larger than, `<= `less than or equal, and `>=` greater than or equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also three logical operators when we want to build multiple compares\n",
    "(multiple conditioning); these are `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `and` operator returns TRUE if (and only if) **all** conditions are TRUE.\n",
    "For instance `5 == 5 and 5 < 6` will return a TRUE because both conditions are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `or` operator returns `TRUE` if at least one condition is true. \n",
    "If **all** conditions are FALSE, then it will return a FALSE. For instance `4 > 3 or 17 > 20 or 3 == 2` will return `TRUE`because the first condition is true.\n",
    "The `not` operator returns `TRUE` if the condition after the `not` keyword is false. Think of it\n",
    "as a way to do a logic reversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Block `if` statement\n",
    "The `if` statement is a common flow control statement. \n",
    "It allows the program to evaluate if a certain condition is satisfied and to perform a designed action based on the result of the evaluation. The structure of an `if` statement is\n",

    "        \n",
    "The `elif` means \"else if\". The `:` colon is an important part of the structure it tells where the action begins. Also there are no scope delimiters like (), or {} . \n",
    "Instead Python uses indentation to isolate blocks of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This convention is hugely important - many other coding environments use delimiters (called scoping delimiters), but Python does not. The indentation itself is the scoping delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inline `if` statement\n",
    "An inline `if` statement is a simpler form of an `if` statement and is more convenient if you\n",
    "only need to perform a simple conditional task. \n",
    "The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    do TaskA `if` condition is true `else` do TaskB\n",
    "    \n",
    "An example would be\n",
    "\n",
    "    myInt = 3\n",
    "    num1 = 12 if myInt == 0 else 13\n",
    "    num1\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative way is to enclose the condition in brackets for some clarity like\n",
    "\n",
    "    myInt = 3\n",
    "    num1 = 12 if (myInt == 0) else 13\n",
    "    num1\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case the result is that `num1` will have the value `13` (unless you set myInt to 0).\n",

    "## Flowcharts\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Flowchart?\n",
    "\n",
    "A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](flowchart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "|Figure 2|Repair Flowchart for a Lamp|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart|\n",
    "|:---|:---|:---|\n",
    "\n",
    "The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a symbol convention (a language) as depicted in Figure 2 below (from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](flowchartsymbols.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "|Figure 1|Flowchart Symbols|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart|\n",
    "|:---|:---|:---|\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM engineers implemented programming flowcharts based upon Goldstine and von Neumann's unpublished report, \"Planning and coding of problems for an electronic computing instrument, Part II, Volume 1\" (1947), which is reproduced in von Neumann's collected works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flowchart became a popular tool for describing computer algorithms, but its popularity decreased in the 1970s, when interactive computer terminals and third-generation programming languages became common tools for computer programming, since algorithms can be expressed more concisely as source code in such languages. Often pseudo-code is used, which uses the common idioms of such languages without strictly adhering to the details of a particular one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays flowcharts are still used for describing computer algorithms.[9] Modern techniques such as UML activity diagrams and Drakon-charts can be considered to be extensions of the flowchart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly all flowcharts focus on on some kind of control, rather than on the particular flow itself!  While quaint today, they are an effective way to document processes in a program and visualize structures.  We recomend you get in the habit of making rudimentary flowcharts, at least at the supervisory level (the sandwich chart above)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are they useful?\n",
    "(paraphrased from [https://www.breezetree.com/articles/top-reasons-to-flowchart](https://www.breezetree.com/articles/top-reasons-to-flowchart))\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's more effective to visualize something graphically that it is to describe it with words. That is the essence of what flowcharts do for you. Flowcharts explain a process clearly through symbols and text. Moreover, flowcharts give you the gist of the process flow in a single glance. The following are some of the more salient reasons to use flowcharts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process Documentation / Training Materials**\n",
    "Another common use for flowcharts is to create process documentation. Although this reason overlaps with regulatory and quality management requirements (below), many non-regulated businesses use flowcharts for their documentation as well. These can range in form from high-level procedures to low-level, detailed work instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think that this applies mainly to large organizations, but small companies can greatly benefit from flowcharting their processes as well. Small enterprises need to be nimble and organized. Standardizing their processes is a great way to achieve this. In fact, the popular entrepreneurial book The E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and What to Do About It by Michael Gerber is based on the fact that small businesses are more likely to succeed if they treat their operations like a franchise. in a nutshell, this means standardizing and documenting their business processes. There's no better way to do that than with flowcharts, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Training materials are often created using flowcharts because they're visually stimulating and easy to understand. A nicely laid out flowchart will gain and hold the reader's attention when a block of text will often fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow Management and Continuous Improvement**\n",
    "Workflows don't manage themselves. To ensure that you are meeting your customers' needs, you need to take control of your business processes. The first step to workflow management is to define the current state of your processes by creating an \"As-Is Flowchart\". That allows you to analyze your processes for waste and inefficiency. After you have identified areas for process improvement, you can then craft new flowcharts to document the leaner processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming**\n",
    "Information technology played a big influence on the use and spread of flowcharts in the 20th century. While Dr. W. Edwards Deming was advocating their use in quality management, professionals in the data processing world were using them to flesh out their programming logic. Flowcharts were a mainstay of procedural programming, however, and with the advent of object oriented programming and various modeling tools, the use of flowcharts for programming is no longer as commonplace as it once was.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, even with in the scope of object oriented programming, complex program logic can be modeled effectively using a flowchart. Moreover, diagramming the user's experience as they navigate through a program is a valuable prerequisite prior to designing the user interface. So flowcharts still have their place in the world of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting Guides**\n",
    "Most of us have come across a troubleshooting flowchart at one time or another. These are usually in the form of Decision Trees that progressively narrow the range of possible solutions based on a series of criteria. The effectiveness of these types of flowcharts depends on how neatly the range of problems and solutions can fit into a simple True/False diagnosis model. A well done troubleshooting flowcharts can cut the problem solving time greatly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regulatory and Quality Management Requirements**\n",
    "Your business processes may be subject to regulatory requirements such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), which requires that your accounting procedures be clearly defined and documented. An easy way to do this is to create accounting flowcharts for all your accounting processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, many organizations fall under certification requirements for quality management systems - such as ISO 9000, TS 16949, or one of the many others. In such environments, flowcharts are not only useful but in certain clauses they are actually mandated."
