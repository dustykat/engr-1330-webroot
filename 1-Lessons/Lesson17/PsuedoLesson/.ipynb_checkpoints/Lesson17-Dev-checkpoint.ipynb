    "Several summary statistics were presented that described key attributes of a dataset, including sample estimates such as $\\bar x$ and $s^2$, of true and unknown population parameters, such as $\\mu$, the population mean, and $\\sigma^2$, the population variance. \n",

    "What follows are methods to describe the uncertainty or reliability of sample estimates. As an alternative to reporting a single estimate, the utility of reporting a range of values called an interval estimate is demonstrated. Both parametric and nonparametric interval estimates are presented. These intervals can also be used to test whether the population parameter is significantly different from some prespecified value.\n",

    "The sample median and sample mean are two types of estimates of the central tendency of a population. Such estimates are called point estimates. By themselves, point estimates do not portray the reliability, or lack of reliability (variability), of these estimates. For example, suppose that two datasets—X and Y—exist, both have a sample mean of about 50 and contain the same number of observations. "

    "At this point we know that the mean values are about the same, but the two datasets are not alike (its the variance stupid!)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative to just point estimates, interval estimates are intervals that have a stated probability of containing the true population value. In our example, the mean for Y is 50 and we are pretty sure of that, because the sample variance is small - if our sample had also tested as normal we could state that the estimate of population mean is 50 +/- 18 ( 3 standard deviations) with probability of 99%.  Such a statement is an interval estimate.\n",

    "In general, we will be presenting two-sided intervals (where the probability of the true value being higher than the upper limit is assumed to be equal to the probability of its being lower than the lower limit). There are also one-sided intervals. The intervals are wider for datasets having greater variability and the same number of data points. \n",

    "Thus, in the above example, an interval between 38 and 62 may have a 95-percent probability of containing the (unknown) true population mean of dataset Y. It would take a much wider interval, say between -6 and 106, to have the same probability of containing the true mean of dataset X. \n",

    "Much of what follows below is borrowed with minor changes for our class from: https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/13/1/Percentiles.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Percentiles\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical data can be sorted in increasing or decreasing order. Thus the values of a numerical data set have a rank order. A percentile is the value at a particular rank.  *We have exploited this is our plotting position formulas earlier.*\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your score on a test is on the 95th percentile, a common interpretation is that only 5% of the scores were higher than yours. The median is the 50th percentile; it is commonly assumed that 50% the values in a data set are above the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "But some care is required in giving percentiles a precise definition that works for all ranks and all lists. To see why, consider an extreme example where all the students in a class score 75 on a test. Then 75 is a natural candidate for the median, but it's not true that 50% of the scores are above 75. Also, 75 is an equally natural candidate for the 95th percentile or the 25th or any other percentile. Ties – that is, equal data values – have to be taken into account when defining percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have to be careful about exactly how far up the list to go when the relevant index isn't clear. For example, what should be the 87th percentile of a collection of 10 values? The 8th value of the sorted collection, or the 9th, or somewhere in between? *Again we have already addressed this issue with our plotting position formulas earlier.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Numerical Example \n",
    "\n",
    "Before giving a general definition of all percentiles, we will define the 80th percentile of a collection of values to be the smallest value in the collection that is at least as large as 80% of all of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider the sizes of the five largest continents – Africa, Antarctica, Asia, North America, and South America – rounded to the nearest million square miles."

    "Once she has calculated the observed value of her statistic, she could just present it as her estimate and go on her merry way. But she knows that her random sample is just one of numerous possible random samples, and thus her estimate is just one of numerous plausible estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "By how much could those estimates vary? To answer this, it appears as though she needs to draw another sample from the population, and compute a new estimate based on the new sample. But she doesn't have the cash to go back to the population and draw another sample.\n",

    "It looks as though the data scientist is stuck, but a method called the bootstrap (or just bootstrapping) can help out. Because it is not feasible to generate new samples from the population, the bootstrap generates new random samples by a method called resampling: the new samples are drawn at random from the original sample.  (Esentially, the orginal sample is now treate as a complete population - its a hack, but surprisingly useful)\n"

    "The sample size is large, so that the distribution of the sample approximates that of the population, and consequently the sample median is not very far from the population median (though of course it is not exactly the same).\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we have one estimate of the parameter. But had the sample come out differently, the estimate would have had a different value. We would like to be able to quantify the amount by which the estimate could vary across samples. That measure of variability will help us measure how accurately we can estimate the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how different the estimate would be if the sample had come out differently, we could just draw another sample from the population, but that would be cheating. We are trying to mimic real life, in which we won't have all the population data at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somehow, we have to get another random sample without sampling from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bootstrap: Resampling from the Sample\n",
    "What we do have is a large random sample from the population. As we know, a large random sample is likely to resemble the population from which it is drawn. This observation allows data scientists to lift themselves up by their own bootstraps: the sampling procedure can be replicated by sampling from the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps of the bootstrap method for generating another random sample that resembles the population:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Treat the original sample as if it were the population.\n",
    "    Draw from the sample, at random with replacement, the same number of times as the original sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to resample the same number of times as the original sample size. The reason is that the variability of an estimate depends on the size of the sample. Since our original sample consisted of 500 employees, our sample median was based on 500 values. To see how different the sample could have been, we have to compare it to the median of other samples of size 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we drew 500 times at random without replacement from our sample of size 500, we would just get the same sample back. By drawing with replacement, we create the possibility for the new samples to be different from the original, because some employees might be drawn more than once and others not at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this a good idea? Because the distribution of the original sample is likely to resemble the population (if we took enough instances), and the distributions of all the \"resamples\" are likely to resemble the original sample. Then by an appeal to the transitive axiom, the distributions of all the resamples are likely to resemble the population as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Resampled Median\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that when the sample method is used without specifying a sample size, by default the sample size equals the number of rows of the table from which the sample is drawn. That's perfect for the bootstrap! Here is one new sample drawn from the original sample, and the corresponding sample median."

    "You can replace 95% by a different value, as long as it's not 100. Suppose you replace 95% by 80% and keep the sample size fixed at 500. Then your intervals of estimates will be shorter than those we simulated here, because the \"middle 80%\" is a smaller range than the \"middle 95%\". Only about 80% of your intervals will contain the parameter."
