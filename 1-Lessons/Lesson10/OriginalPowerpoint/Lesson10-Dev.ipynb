    "This lesson covers concepts related to modeling data - it is the start of several lessons on the subject.  The ultimate goal is to explain observed behavior with a model (like $\\textbf{F} = m\\textbf{a}$) so that the model can be used to predict behavior.  If we are predicting between existing observations, that's interpolation and is relatively straightforward.  If we are predicting beyond existing observations, that's called extrapolation and is less straightforward.\n",

    "### What is causality? (A long winded psuedo definition!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Causality is the relationship between causes and effects. \n",
    "The notion of causality does not have a uniform definition in the sciences, and is studied using philosophy and statistics. \n",
    "From the perspective of physics, it is generally believed that causality cannot occur between an effect and an event that is not in the back (past) light cone of said effect. \n",
    "Similarly, a cause could not have an effect outside its front (future) light cone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are some recent articles regarding Closed Time Loops, that explains causal consistency. The second paper is by an undergraduate student! \n",
    "    1. https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.040605\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/aba4bc\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both to some extent theoretically support our popular notion of time travel (aka Dr. Who)  without pesky paradoxes; someone with creative writing juices, could have a good science fiction career using these papers as a starting thesis!\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical physics, an effect cannot occur before its cause. \n",
    "In Einstein's theory of special relativity, causality means that an effect can not occur from a cause that is not in the back (past) light cone of that event. \n",
    "Similarly, a cause cannot have an effect outside its front (future) light cone. \n",
    "These restrictions are consistent with the assumption that causal influences cannot travel faster than the speed of light and/or backwards in time. In quantum field theory, observables of events with a spacelike relationship, \"elsewhere\", have to commute, so the order of observations or measurements of such observables do not impact each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causality in this context should not be confused with Newton's second law, which is related to the conservation of momentum, and is a consequence of the spatial homogeneity of physical laws. The word causality in this context means that all effects must have specific causes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another requirement, at least valid at the level of human experience, is that cause and effect be mediated across space and time (requirement of contiguity). This requirement has been very influential in the past, in the first place as a result of direct observation of causal processes (like pushing a cart), in the second place as a problematic aspect of Newton's theory of gravitation (attraction of the earth by the sun by means of action at a distance) replacing mechanistic proposals like Descartes' vortex theory; in the third place as an incentive to develop dynamic field theories (e.g., Maxwell's electrodynamics and Einstein's general theory of relativity) restoring contiguity in the transmission of influences in a more successful way than in Descartes' theory.\n",

    "### Correlation (Causality's mimic!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The literary (as in writing!) formulation of causality is a \"why?, because ...\" structure (sort of like if=>then) The answer to a because question, should be the \"cause.\"  Many authors use \"since\" to imply cause, but it is incorrect grammar - since answers the question of when?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think \"CAUSE\" => \"EFFECT\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation doesn’t mean cause (although it is a really good predictor of the crap we all buy - its why Amazon is sucessfull)\n",

    "The correlation between money spent on pets and the number of lawyers is quite good (nearly perfect), so does having pets cause lawyers?  Of course not, the general social economic conditions that improve general wealth, and create sufficient disposable income to have pets (here we mean companion animals, not food on the hoof) also creates conditions for laywers to proliferate, hence a good correlation. \n",

    "Concentrations of atrazine and nitrate in shallow groundwaters are measured in wells over a\n",
    "several county area. For each sample, the concentration of one is plotted versus the\n",

    "November than in other months. Has the amount of November precipitation significantly\n",
    "changed over the last 70 years, showing a gradual change in the climate of the area? How might\n",
    "this be tested?\n",
    "\n",
    "The above situations require a measure of the strength of association between two continuous\n",
    "variables, such as between two chemical concentrations, or between amount of precipitation and\n",
    "time. How do they co-vary? One class of measures are called correlation coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also important is how the significance of that association can be tested for, to determine whether the observed pattern differs from what is expected due entirely to chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a correlation coefficient is calculated, the data should be plotted on a scatterplot. No\n",
    "single numerical measure can substitute for the visual insight gained from a plot. Many different\n",
    "patterns can produce the same correlation coefficient, and similar strengths of relationships can\n",
    "produce differing coefficients, depending on the curvature of the relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications\n",
    "Most research questions attempt to explain cause and effect. \n",
    "- In experimental research, the relationship is constructed and the experiment is somewhat of a failure if none of the presumed causal (causal == explainatory) variables influence the response (response == effect)\n",
    "- In a data science experimental context, causality may be impossible to establish, however correlations can be established and exploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, many studies involve observations on a group of individuals, a factor of interest called a treatment (explainatory variable, predictor variable, predictor feature ...), and an outcome (response, effect, state, predicted value ...) measured on each individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presumptive establishment of causality takes place in two stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, an association is observed. Any relation between the treatment and the outcome is called an association (we can measure the strength of the association using correlation coefficients!).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Second, A more careful analysis is used to establish causality. \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. One approach would be to control all variables other than the suspected (explainatory) variables, which for any meaningful process is essentially impossible. \n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Another approach is to establish randomized control studies:\n",
    "        1. Start with a sample from a population (e.g. volunteers to test Covid 19 vaccines)\n",
    "        2. Randomly assign members to either\n",
    "            a. Control group\n",
    "            b. Treatment group\n",
    "        3. Expose the two groups identically, except the control group recieves a false (null) treatment\n",
    "        4. Compare the responses of the two groups, if they are same, there exists no evidence that the treatment variable CAUSES a response\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts can be extended with some ingenuity to engineered systems and natural systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "Confounding also occurs when explainatory variables are correlated to another, for instance flood flows are well correlated to drainage area, main channel length, mean annual precipitation, main channel slope, and elevation. However main channel length is itself strongly correlated to drainage area, so much so as to be nearly useless as an explainatory variable when drainage area is retained in a data model.  It would be a \"confounding variable\" in this context."
