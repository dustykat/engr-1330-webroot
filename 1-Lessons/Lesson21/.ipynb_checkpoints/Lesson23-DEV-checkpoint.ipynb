We could be happy with the small error from **c** = 0.6 and end this exercise now. But let’s go on for just a bit longer. \n",

    "Split again to **c**=0.625, and overshoot is only (-0.3629) (we could sucessively split the **c** values until we are close enough. The method just illustrated is called bisection, and the important point is that we avoided any mathematics other than bigger/smaller and multiplication and subtraction; hence just arithmetic.)\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s much much better than before. We have an output value of 62.5 which is only wrong by 0.3629 from the correct 62.137. So that last effort taught us that we should moderate how much we nudge the value of **c**. If the outputs are getting close to the correct answer - that is, the error is getting smaller - then don’t nudge the constant so much. That way we avoid overshooting the right value, like we did earlier. Again without getting too distracted by exact ways of working out **c**, and to remain focussed on this idea of successively refining it, we could suggest that the correction is a fraction of the error. That’s intuitively right - a big error means a bigger correction is needed, and a tiny error means we need the teeniest of nudges to **c**. What we’ve just done, believe it or not, is walked through the very core process of learning in a neural network - we’ve trained the machine to get better and better at giving the right answer. It is worth pausing to reflect on that - we’ve not solved a problem exactly in one step. Instead, we’ve taken a very different approach by trying an answer and improving it repeatedly. Some use the term **iterative** and it means repeatedly improving an answer bit by bit.\n"

    "### Training A Simple Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to **train** our linear classifier to correctly classify bugs as ladybirds or caterpillars. We saw above this is simply about refining the slope of the dividing line that separates the two groups of points on a plot of big width and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we do this? We need some examples to learn from. The following table shows two examples, just to keep this exercise simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "|Example| Width| Length| Bug |\n",
    "|:---|:---|:---|:---|\n",
    "|1 | 3.0 | 1.0 | ladybird |\n",
    "|2 | 1.0 | 3.0 | caterpillar |\n",
    "\n",
    "We have an example of a bug which has width 3.0 and length 1.0, which we know is a ladybird. We also have an example of a bug which is longer at 3.0 and thinner at 1.0, which is a caterpillar. This is a set of examples which we declare to be the truth. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is these examples which will help refine the slope of the classifier function. Examples of truth used to teach a predictor or a classifier are called the **training data.**\n",
    "Let’s plot these two training data examples. Visualising data is often very helpful to get a better understand of it, a feel for it, which isn’t easy to get just by looking at a list or table of numbers.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s start with a random dividing line, just to get started somewhere. Looking back at our miles to kilometre predictor, we had a linear function whose parameter we adjusted. We can do the same here, because the dividing line is a straight line: $y = Ax+b$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve deliberately used the names $y$ and $x$ instead of length and width, because strictly speaking, the line is not a predictor here. It doesn’t convert width to length, like we previously converted miles to kilometres. Instead, it is a dividing line, a classifier. To keep the garden bug scenario as simple as possible we will choose a zero intercept $b=0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We saw before that the parameter $A$ controls the slope of the line. The larger $A$ is the larger the slope. Let’s go for $A$ is 0.25 to get started. The dividing line is $y = 0.25x$. Let’s plot this line on the same plot of training data to see what it looks like: \n",

    "\n",
    "Well, we can see that the line $y = 0.25x$ isn’t a good classifier already without the need to do any calculations. The line doesn’t divide the two types of bug - We can’t say “if the bug is above the line then it is a caterpillar” because the ladybird is above the line too.\n",
    "\n",
    "So intuitively we need to move the line up a bit. We’ll resist the temptation to do this by looking at the plot and drawing a suitable line. We want to see if we can find a repeatable recipe to do this, a series of computer instructions, which computer scientists call an **algorithm**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the first training example: the width is 3.0 and length is 1.0 for a ladybird. \n",
    "If we tested the $y = Ax$ function with this example where $x$ is 3.0, we’d get $y = (0.25) * (3.0) = 0.75$ \n",
    "The function, with the parameter $A$ set to the initial arbitrary chosen value of 0.25, is suggesting that for a bug of width 3.0, the length should be 0.75. \n",
    "We know that’s too small because the training data example tells us it must be a length of 1.0. So we have a difference, an **error**. \n",
    "Just as before, with the miles to kilometres predictor, we can use this error to inform how we adjust the parameter $A$. But let’s think about what $y$ should be again. \n",
    "If $y$ was 1.0 then the line goes right through the point where the ladybird sits at $(x,y) = (3.0, 1.0)$. \n",
    "It’s a subtle point but we don’t actually want that. \n",
    "We want the line to go above that point. \n",
    "Why? Because we want all the ladybird points to be below the line, not on it. \n",
    "The line needs to be a *dividing line* between ladybirds and caterpillars, not a predictor of a bug’s length given its width. \n",
    "So let’s try to aim for $y = 1.1$ when $x = 3.0$. \n",
    "It’s just a small number above 1.0, We could have chosen 1.2, or even 1.3, but we don’t want a larger number like 10 or 100 because that would make it more likely that the line goes above both ladybirds and caterpillars, resulting in a separator that wasn’t useful at all. So the desired target is 1.1, and the error **E** is \n",
    "\n",
    "    error = (desired target ­ actual output)\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is, $E = 1.1 \\times 0.75 = 0.35$ \n",

    "If we know this, then we can understand how changing one affects the other (correlation anyone?). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with the linear function for the classifier: $y = Ax$ \n",

    "That’s remarkable! The error **E** is related to $\\Delta A$ in a very simple way. \n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to know how much to adjust $A$ by to improve the slope of the line so it is a better classifier, being informed by the error **E**. \n",
    "To do this we simply re-arrange that last equation: $\\Delta A = \\textbf{E}/ x$\n",
    "That’s the magic expression we’ve been looking for. We can use the error **E** to refine the slope $A$ of the classifying line by an amount  $\\Delta A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s update that initial slope. The error was 0.35 and the $x$ was 3.0. \n",
    "That gives $\\Delta A = \\textbf{E}/ x$ as 0.35/ 3.0 = 0.1167. \n",
    "That means we need to change the current $A = 0.25$ by $0.1167$. \n",
    "That means the new improved value for $A$ is (A​ + ΔA​) which is 0.25 + 0.1167 = 0.3667. As it happens, the calculated value of $y$ with this new $A$ is 1.1 as you’d expect - it’s the desired target value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have a method for refining that parameter $A$, informed by the current error. Now we’re done with one training example, let’s learn from the next one. Here we have a known true pairing of $x$ = 1.0 and $y$ = 3.0. Let’s see what happens when we put $x$ = 1.0 into the linear function which is now using the updated $A$ = 0.3667. We get $y$ = 0.3667 * 1.0 = 0.3667. \n",
    "That’s not very close to the training example with $y$ = 3.0 at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same reasoning as before that we want the line to not cross the training data but instead be just above or below it, we can set the desired target value at 2.9. This way the training example of a caterpillar is just above the line, not on it. The error E​ is (2.9 ­ 0.3667) = 2.5333. That’s a bigger error than before, but if you think about it, all we’ve had so far for the linear function to learn from is a single training example, which clearly biases the line towards that single example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s update the $A$ again, just like we did before. The $\\Delta A$ is $\\textbf{E}/x$ which is 2.5333/ 1.0 = 2.5333. That means the even newer $A$ is 0.3667 + 2.5333 = 2.9. That means for $x = 1.0$ the function gives 2.9 as the answer, which is what the desired value was.\n",

    "The line updates to give each desired value for y. \n",
    "If we keep doing this, updating for each training data example, all we get is that the final update simply matches the last training example closely. We might as well have not bothered with all previous training examples. In effect we are throwing away any learning that previous training examples might gives us and just learning from the last one. How do we fix this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy! And this is an important idea in machine learning.**We moderate** the updates. That is, we calm them down a bit. Instead of jumping enthusiastically to each new $A$, we take a fraction of the change $\\Delta A$, not all of it. This way we move in the direction that the training example suggests, but do so slightly cautiously, keeping some of the previous value which was arrived at through potentially many previous training iterations. We saw this idea of moderating our refinements before - with the simpler miles to kilometres predictor, where we nudged the parameter **c** as a fraction of the actual error. \n",
    "\n",
    "This moderation, has another very powerful and useful side effect. When the training data itself can’t be trusted to be perfectly true, and contains errors or noise, both of which are normal in real world measurements, the moderation can dampen the impact of those errors or noise. It smooths them out. Ok let’s rerun that again, but this time we’ll add a moderation into the update formula: $\\Delta A = L (E/ x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The moderating factor is often called a **learning rate**, and we’ve called it $L$. Let’s pick $L$ = 0.5 as a reasonable fraction just to get started. It simply means we only update half as much as would have done without moderation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Running through that all again, we have an initial $A$ = 0.25. The first training example gives us y = 0.25 * 3.0 = 0.75. A desired value of 1.1 gives us an error of 0.35. The $\\Delta A = L (E/ x)$ = 0.5 * 0.35/ 3.0 = 0.0583. The updated $A$ is 0.25 + 0.0583 = 0.3083. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trying out this new A on the training example at $x$ = 3.0 gives y​ = 0.3083 * 3.0 = 0.9250. The line now falls on the wrong side of the training example because it is below 1.1 but it’s not a bad result if you consider it a first refinement step of many to come. It did move in the right direction away from the initial line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s press on to the second training data example at $x$ = 1.0. Using $A$ = 0.3083 we have y = 0.3083 * 1.0 = 0.3083. The desired value was 2.9 so the error is (2.9 * 0.3083) = 2.5917. The $\\Delta A = L (E/ x)$ = 0.5 * 2.5917/ 1.0 = 1.2958. The even newer $A$ is now 0.3083 + 1.2958 = 1.6042. Let’s visualise again the initial, improved and final line to see if moderating updates leads to a better dividing line between ladybird and caterpillar regions.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is really good! Even with these two simple training examples, and a relatively simple update method using a moderating **learning rate**, we have very rapidly arrived at a good dividing line $y = Ax$ where $A$ is 1.6042. Let’s not diminish what we’ve achieved. We’ve achieved an automated method of learning to classify from examples that is remarkably effective given the simplicity of the approach."
