    "\n",
    "    The general idea behind our efforts was to use a set of observed events (samples) to capture the relationship between one or more predictor (AKA input, indipendent) variables and an output (AKA response, dependent) variable. The nature of the dependent variables differentiates *__regression__* and *__classification__* problems. \n",

    "    Regression problems have continuous and usually unbounded outputs. An example is when you’re estimating the salary as a function of experience and education level. Or all the examples we have covered so far! \n",
    "    \n",
    "    On the other hand, classification problems have discrete and finite outputs called classes or categories. For example, predicting if an employee is going to be promoted or not (true or false) is a classification problem. There are two main types of classification problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Binary or binomial classification: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    exactly two classes to choose between (usually 0 and 1, true and false, or positive and negative)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Multiclass or multinomial classification:\n",
    "    \n",

    "- __When Do We Need Classification?__\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We can apply classification in many fields of science and technology. For example, text classification algorithms are used to separate legitimate and spam emails, as well as positive and negative comments. Other examples involve medical applications, biological classification, credit scoring, and more.\n",

    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- __What is logistic regression?__\n",
    "    Logistic regression is a fundamental classification technique. It belongs to the group of linear classifiers and is somewhat similar to polynomial and linear regression. Logistic regression is fast and relatively uncomplicated, and it’s convenient for users to interpret the results. Although it’s essentially a method for binary classification, it can also be applied to multiclass problems. \n",

    "    \n",
    "    Logistic regression is a statistical method for predicting binary classes. The outcome or target variable is dichotomous in nature. Dichotomous means there are only two possible classes. For example, it can be used for cancer detection problems. It computes the probability of an event occurrence. Logistic regression can be considered a special case of linear regression where the target variable is categorical in nature. It uses a log of odds as the dependent variable. Logistic Regression predicts the probability of occurrence of a binary event utilizing a logit function. HOW?\n",
    "    Remember the general format of the multiple linear regression model: ![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1534281880/image1_ga8gze.png) Where, y is dependent variable and x1, x2 ... and Xn are explanatory variables. This was, as you know by now, a linear function. There is another famous function known as the *__Sigmoid Function__*, also called *__logistic function__*. Here is the equation for the Sigmoid function: ![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1534281880/image2_kwxquj.png) This image shows the sigmoid function (or S-shaped curve) of some variable 𝑥: ![](https://files.realpython.com/media/log-reg-1.e32deaa7cbac.png) As you see, The sigmoid function has values very close to either 0 or 1 across most of its domain. It can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1. If the curve goes to positive infinity, y predicted will become 1, and if the curve goes to negative infinity, y predicted will become 0. This fact makes it suitable for application in classification methods since we are dealing with two discrete classes (labels, categories, ...). If the output of the sigmoid function is more than 0.5, we can classify the outcome as 1 or YES, and if it is less than 0.5, we can classify it as 0 or NO. This cutoff value (threshold) is not always fixed at 0.5. If we apply the Sigmoid function on linear regression: ![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1534281880/image3_qldafx.png) Notice the difference between linear regression and logistic regression: ![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1534281070/linear_vs_logistic_regression_edxw03.png) \n",

    "- __How to assess the performance of logistic regression?__\n",
    "\n",
    "    Binary classification has four possible types of results:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - True negatives: correctly predicted negatives (zeros)\n",
    "    - True positives: correctly predicted positives (ones)\n",
    "    - False negatives: incorrectly predicted negatives (zeros)\n",
    "    - False positives: incorrectly predicted positives (ones)\n",
    "    \n",
    "   We usually evaluate the performance of a classifier by comparing the actual and predicted outputsand counting the correct and incorrect predictions. A confusion matrix is a table that is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. \n",
    "    ![](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=699x10000:format=png/path/s8ff3310143614e07/image/iab2d53abc26a2bc7/version/1549760945/image.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "    Some indicators of binary classifiers include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The most straightforward indicator of classification accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (or observations). \n",
    "    - The positive predictive value is the ratio of the number of true positives to the sum of the numbers of true and false positives.\n",
    "    - The negative predictive value is the ratio of the number of true negatives to the sum of the numbers of true and false negatives.\n",
    "    - The sensitivity (also known as recall or true positive rate) is the ratio of the number of true positives to the number of actual positives.\n",
    "    - The precision score quantifies the ability of a classifier to not label a negative example as positive. The precision score can be interpreted as the probability that a positive prediction made by the classifier is positive.\n",
    "    - The specificity (or true negative rate) is the ratio of the number of true negatives to the number of actual negatives. \n",
    "    ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/936/0*R7idSv1bja3CLC8s.png) \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The extent of importance of recall and precision depends on the problem. Achieving a high recall is more important than getting a high precision in cases like when we would like to detect as many heart patients as possible. For some other models, like classifying whether a bank customer is a loan defaulter or not, it is desirable to have a high precision since the bank wouldn’t want to lose customers who were denied a loan based on the model’s prediction that they would be defaulters. \n",
    "    There are also a lot of situations where both precision and recall are equally important. Then we would aim for not only a high recall but a high precision as well. In such cases, we use something called F1-score. F1-score is the Harmonic mean of the Precision and Recall: ![](https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/f1score-300x73.png) This is easier to work with since now, instead of balancing precision and recall, we can just aim for a good F1-score and that would be indicative of a good Precision and a good Recall value as well.\n",

    "#### The \"winequality.csv\" dataset is provided with information related to red vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests. Follow the steps and answer the question. *Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).* \n",

    "|fixed acidity |most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)|\n",
    "|volatile acidity |the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste|\n",
    "|citric acid |found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines|\n",
    "|residual sugar |the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter|\n",
    "|chlorides |the amount of salt in the wine|\n",
    "|free sulfur dioxide |the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion|\n",
    "|total sulfur dioxide |amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine| \n",
    "|density |the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content|\n",
    "|pH |describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4|\n",
    "|sulphates |a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial|\n",

Change the column names to **('acidity_f','acidity_v','ca','rsugar','chlorides','sulfurd_f','sulfurd_t','density','ph','sulphates','alcohol','qualityscore')**. Explore the dataframe and in a markdown cell breifly describe the different variables in your own words. <br>\n",

    "- Step2: Use logistic regression and ('acidity_f', 'ca', 'chlorides', 'sulfurd_t', 'ph', 'alcohol') as predictors to predict the quality of wine. Use a 70/30 split for training and testing. Then, get the confusion matrix and use classification_report to describe the performance of your model. Also, get a heatmap and visually assess the predictions of your model. Explain the result of this analysis in a markdown cell.\n",

Then, get the confusion matrix and use classification_report to describe the performance of your model. Also, get a heatmap and visually assess the predictions of your model. Explain the result of this analysis in a markdown cell.\n",
