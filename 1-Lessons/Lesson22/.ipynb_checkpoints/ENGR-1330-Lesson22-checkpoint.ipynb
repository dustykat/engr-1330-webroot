    "Split again to **c**=0.625, and overshoot is only (-0.3629) (we could sucessively split the **c** values until we are close enough. The method just illustrated is called bisection, and the important point is that we avoided any mathematics other than bigger/smaller and multiplication and subtraction; hence just arithmetic.)\n",

    "That’s much much better than before. We have an output value of 62.5 which is only wrong by 0.3629 from the correct 62.137. So that last effort taught us that we should moderate how much we nudge the value of **c**. If the outputs are getting close to the correct answer - that is, the error is getting smaller - then don’t nudge the constant so much. That way we avoid overshooting the right value, like we did earlier. Again without getting too distracted by exact ways of working out **c**, and to remain focussed on this idea of successively refining it, we could suggest that the correction is a fraction of the error. That’s intuitively right - a big error means a bigger correction is needed, and a tiny error means we need the teeniest of nudges to **c**. What we’ve just done, believe it or not, is walked through the very core process of learning in a neural network - we’ve trained the machine to get better and better at giving the right answer. It is worth pausing to reflect on that - we’ve not solved a problem exactly in one step. Instead, we’ve taken a very different approach by trying an answer and improving it repeatedly. Some use the term **iterative** and it means repeatedly improving an answer bit by bit.\n"

    "Easy! And this is an important idea in machine learning.**We moderate** the updates. That is, we calm them down a bit. Instead of jumping enthusiastically to each new $A$, we take a fraction of the change $\\Delta A$, not all of it. This way we move in the direction that the training example suggests, but do so slightly cautiously, keeping some of the previous value which was arrived at through potentially many previous training iterations. We saw this idea of moderating our refinements before - with the simpler miles to kilometres predictor, where we nudged the parameter **c** as a fraction of the actual error. \n",

    "This moderation, has another very powerful and useful side effect. When the training data itself can’t be trusted to be perfectly true, and contains errors or noise, both of which are normal in real world measurements, the moderation can dampen the impact of those errors or noise. It smooths them out. Ok let’s rerun that again, but this time we’ll add a moderation into the update formula: $\\Delta A = L (E/ x)$\n",

The line now falls on the wrong side of the training example because it is below 1.1 but it’s not a bad result if you consider it a first refinement step of many to come. It did move in the right direction away from the initial line. \n",

    "Let’s press on to the second training data example at $x$ = 1.0. Using $A$ = 0.3083 we have y = 0.3083 * 1.0 = 0.3083. The desired value was 2.9 so the error is (2.9 * 0.3083) = 2.5917. The $\\Delta A = L (E/ x)$ = 0.5 * 2.5917/ 1.0 = 1.2958. The even newer $A$ is now 0.3083 + 1.2958 = 1.6042.

Even with these two simple training examples, and a relatively simple update method using a moderating **learning rate**, we have very rapidly arrived at a good dividing line $y = Ax$ where $A$ is 1.6042.

    "From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) (emphasis is mine):\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the **logistic model** (or logit model) is used to model the probability of a certain **class** or **event** existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc. Each object being detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1, with a sum of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a **statistical model** that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression). Mathematically, a **binary logistic model** has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass/fail which is represented by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled \"0\" and \"1\". In the **logistic model**, the log-odds (the logarithm of the odds) for the value labeled \"1\" is a linear combination of one or more independent variables (\"predictors\"); the independent variables can each be a binary variable (two classes, coded by an indicator variable) or a continuous variable (any real value). \n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding probability of the value labeled \"1\" can vary between 0 (certainly the value \"0\") and 1 (certainly the value \"1\"), hence the labeling; the function that converts log-odds to probability is the logistic function, hence the name. The unit of measurement for the log-odds scale is called a logit, from logistic unit, hence the alternative names. Analogous models with a different sigmoid function instead of the logistic function can also be used, such as the probit model; the defining characteristic of the logistic model is that increasing one of the independent variables multiplicatively scales the odds of the given outcome at a constant rate, with each independent variable having its own parameter; for a binary dependent variable this generalizes the odds ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a binary logistic regression model, the dependent variable has two levels (categorical). Outputs with more than two values are modeled by multinomial logistic regression and, if the multiple categories are ordered, by ordinal logistic regression (for example the proportional odds ordinal logistic model). The logistic regression model itself simply **models probability of output** in terms of input and does not perform statistical classification (it is not a classifier), though it can be used to make a classifier, for instance by choosing a cutoff value and classifying inputs with probability greater than the cutoff as one class, below the cutoff as the other; this is a common way to make a binary classifier. The coefficients are generally not computed by a closed-form expression, unlike linear least squares; see § Model fitting. $\\dots$\n",
