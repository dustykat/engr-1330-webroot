    "A computer file is a computer resource for recording data discretely (not in the secretive context, but specifically somewhere on a piece of hardware) in a computer storage device. Just as words can be written to paper, so can information be written to a computer file. Files can be edited and transferred through the internet on that particular computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of computer files, designed for different purposes. A file may be designed to store a picture, a written message, a video, a computer program, or a wide variety of other kinds of data. Some types of files can store several types of information at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using computer programs, a person can open, read, change, save, and close a computer file. Computer files may be reopened, modified, and copied an arbitrary number of times.\n",

    "### Path\n",
    "A path, the general form of the name of a file or directory, specifies a unique location in a file system. A path points to a file system location by following the directory tree hierarchy expressed in a string of characters in which path components, separated by a delimiting character, represent each directory. The delimiting character is most commonly the slash (`/`), the backslash character (`\\`), or colon (`:`), though some operating systems may use a different delimiter.\n",
    "Paths are used extensively in computing to represent the directory/file relationships common in modern operating systems, and are essential in the construction of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Resources can be represented by either absolute or relative paths.\n",
    "As an example consider the following two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. /Users/theodore/MyGit/@atomickitty/hurri-sensors/.git/Guest.conf \n",
    "2. /etc/apache2/users/Guest.conf\n",
    "\n",
    "They both have the same file name, but are located on different paths. \n",
    "Failure to provide the path when addressing the file can be a problem. \n",
    "Another way to interpret is that the two unique files actually have different names, and only part of those names is common (Guest.conf)\n",
    "The two names above (including the path) are called fully qualified filenames (or absolute names), a relative path (usually relative to the file or program of interest depends on where in the directory structure the file lives. \n",
    "If we are currently in the .git directory (the first file) the path to the file is just the filename."

    "\n",
    "1. Text Files. Text files are regular files that contain information readable by the user. This information is usually stored as ASCII with various encoding extensions (to handle other alphabets and emojis). You can display and print these files. The lines of a text file must not contain NULL characters, and none can exceed a prescribed (by architecture) length, including the new-line character.  The term text file does not prevent the inclusion of control or other nonprintable characters (other than NUL). Therefore, standard utilities that list text files as inputs or outputs are either able to process the special characters gracefully or they explicitly describe their limitations within their individual sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Binary Files. Binary files are regular files that contain information readable by the computer. Binary files may be executable files that instruct the system to accomplish a job. Commands and programs are stored in executable, binary files. Special compiling programs translate ASCII text into binary code.  The only real difference between text and binary files is that text files have lines of some prescribed length, with no NULL characters, each terminated by a new-line character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Directory Files. Directory files contain information the system needs to access all types of files, but they do not contain the actual file data. As a result, directories occupy less space than a regular file and give the file system structure flexibility and depth. Each directory entry represents either a file or a subdirectory. Each entry contains the name of the file and the file's index node reference number (i-node). The i-node points to the unique index node assigned to the file. The i-node describes the location of the data associated with the file. Directories are created and controlled by a separate set of commands."
