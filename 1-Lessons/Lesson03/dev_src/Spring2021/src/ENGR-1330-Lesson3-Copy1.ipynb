    "- `if` statement\n",
    "- `if....else` statements\n",
    "- `if....elif....else` statements\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common conditional operation is comparison. If we wish to compare whether two\n",
    "variables are the same we use the == (double equal sign).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example x == y means the program will ask whether x and y have the same value. \n",
    "If they do, the result is TRUE if not then the result is FALSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other comparison signs are `!=` does NOT equal, `<` smaller than, `> `larger than, `<= `less than or equal, and `>=` greater than or equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also three logical operators when we want to build multiple compares\n",
    "(multiple conditioning); these are `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `and` operator returns TRUE if (and only if) **all** conditions are TRUE.\n",
    "For instance `5 == 5 and 5 < 6` will return a TRUE because both conditions are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `or` operator returns `TRUE` if at least one condition is true. \n",
    "If **all** conditions are FALSE, then it will return a FALSE. For instance `4 > 3 or 17 > 20 or 3 == 2` will return `TRUE`because the first condition is true.\n",
    "The `not` operator returns `TRUE` if the condition after the `not` keyword is false. Think of it\n",
