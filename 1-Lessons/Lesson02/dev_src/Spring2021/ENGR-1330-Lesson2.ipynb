    "## Programming Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational thinking (CT)** refers to the thought processes involved in expressing solutions as computational steps or algorithms that can be carried out by a computer.  CT is a process for breaking down a problem into smaller parts, looking for patterns in the problems, identifying what kind of information is needed, developing a step-by-step solution, and implementing that solution. Recall the 5 fundamental CT concepts are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decomposition: the process of taking a complex problem and breaking it into more manageable sub-problems. Decomposition often leaves a **framework** of sub-problems that later have to be **assembled (system integration)** to produce a desired solution.\n",
    "2. Pattern Recognition: finding similarities, or shared characteristics of problems.  Allows a complex problem to become easier to solve. Allows use of same solution method ( **automation** ) for each occurrence of the pattern. \n",
    "3. Abstraction : Determine important characteristics of the problem and use these characteristics to create a representation of the problem. \n",
    "4. Algorithms : Step-by-step instructions of how to solve a problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm). Identifies what is to be done, and the order in which they should be done.\n",
    "5. System Integration: the assembly of the parts above into the complete (integrated) solution.  Integration combines parts into a **program** which is the realization of an algorithm using a syntax that the computer can understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming** is (generally) writing code in a specific programming language to address a certain problem. In the above list it is largely contained within the algorithms concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### iPython\n",
    "The programming language we will use is Python (actually iPython). Python is an example of a high-level language; there are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. Machine language is the encoding of instructions in binary so that they can be directly executed by the computer. Assembly language uses a slightly easier format to refer to the low level instructions. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages. To be exact, computers can actually only execute programs written in machine language. Thus, programs written in a high-level language (and even those in assembly language) have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. \n",
    "- Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with just a  few modifications. \n",
    "- Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer (chipset-specific for sure, in some cases hardware specific) and have to be rewritten to run on other processors. (e.g. x86-64 vs. arm7 vs. aarch64 vs. PowerPC ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters and compilers. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a language, python is a formal language that has certain requirements and structure called \"syntax.\" Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to **tokens** and **structure**. **Tokens** are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. The second type of syntax rule pertains to the **structure of a statement** specifically in the way the tokens are arranged. "

    "$$ e = m \\cdot c^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation the tokens are $e$,$m$,$c$,$=$,$\\cdot$, and the structure is parsed from left to right as into the token named $e$ place the result of the product of the contents of the tokens $m$ and $c^2$. Given that the speed of light is some universal constant, the only things that can change are the contents of $m$ and the resulting change in $e$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above discourse, the tokens $e$,$m$,$c$ are names for things that can have values -- we will call these variables (or constants as appropriate).  The tokens $=$,$\\cdot$, and $~^2$ are symbols for various arithmetic operations -- we will call these operators.  The structure of the equation is specific -- we will call it a statement.\n",
