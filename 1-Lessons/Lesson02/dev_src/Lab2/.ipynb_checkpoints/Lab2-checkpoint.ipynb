    "the variable represents.\n",

    "hardwire the arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to store the time of concentration for some hydrologic calculation. \n",
    "To do so, we can name a variable `TimeOfConcentration`, and then `assign` a value to the variable,\n",

    "\n",
    "    TimeOfConcentration = 0.0\n",
    "    \n",
    "After this assignment statement the variable is created in the program and has a value of 0.0. \n",

    "\n",
    "Variable names in Python can only contain letters (a - z, A - Z), numerals (0 - 9), or underscores. \n",

    "The names can be reasonably long. \n",

    "The type affects the kind of arithmetic operations that are allowed (as well as the kind of arithmetic - integer versus real arithmetic; lexicographical ordering of alphanumeric , etc.)\n",
    "In scientific programming, a common (and really difficult to detect) source of slight inaccuracies (that tend to snowball as the program runs) is mixed mode arithmetic required because two numeric values are of different types (integer and real).\n",

    "Integers are numbers without any fractional portion (nothing after the decimal point { which\n",

    "is not an integer, and 1.0 is also not an integer (the presence of the decimal point makes the\n",
    "number a real).\n",
    "\n",

    "decimal parts. The numbers 3.14159, -0.001, 11.11, 1., are all floats. \n",
    "The last one is especially tricky, if you don't notice the decimal point you might think it is an integer but the\n",

    "numbers can be included. The numbers in a string are simply characters and cannot be\n",
    "directly used in arithmetic. \n",
    "There are some kinds of arithmetic that can be performed on strings but generally we process string variables to capture the text nature of their contents. \n",
    "To declare a string in Python, just assign the variable name to a string value - the trick is the value is enclosed in quotes. \n",
    "The quotes are delimiters that tell the program that the characters between the quotes are characters and are to be treated as literal representation.\n",
