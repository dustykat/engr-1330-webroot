    "As a practical matter, most probabilities are relative frequencies.  If you are a Bayesian statistician, its just conditioned relative frequency.  By convention, probabilities are numbers between 0 and 1, or, equivalently, 0% and 100%. Impossible events have probability 0. Events that are certain have probability 1.\n",

    "As a silly example, the probability that a Great White shark will swim up your sewer pipe and bite you on the bottom, is zero.  Unless the sewer pipe is pretty big, the shark cannot physically get to you - hence impossible.  Now if you are swimming in a freshwater river, lets say the Columbia river on the Oregon border, that probability of sharkbite increases a bit, perhaps 1 in 100 million, or 0.000001% chance of a Great White shark (a pelagic species adapted to salt water), swimming upriver in freshwater, past a couple of fish ladders, still hungry enough bite your bottom. It would be a rare bite indeed; but not physically impossible.\n",

So without a squirrel suit and a parachute you are pretty much going to expire with probability 100% chance.\n",

    "\n",
