When the computer makes a guess, the user enters a hint; the letter 'H' indicates the computer's guess was too high, the letter 'L' means the computer guessed too low. The program should use the hint to revise its guess. If the user enters the letter 'W' that means the computer guessed the number correctly and the computer should reply \"I won. As agreed you should now self-terminate\". If the computer takes 5 guesses without winning it should print a message \"I lost. However I cannot self-terminate, you will have to end me!\""
