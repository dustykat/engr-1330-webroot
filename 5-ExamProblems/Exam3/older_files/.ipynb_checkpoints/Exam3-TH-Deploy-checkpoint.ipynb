    "The Colorado River is the 18th longest river in the United States and the longest river wholly located in Texas. The Colorado River originates from the Llano Estacado region in west Texas with an elevation of 1000 meters, flows southeast through eleven major reservoirs (e.g. Lake J.B. Thomas, E.V. Spence Reservoir and Lake O.H. Ivie) and eventually empties into the Gulf of Mexico near Matagorda. The river is considered as the life blood of Texas due to its essential role for the stateâ€™s economy, environment, agriculture, power production and developing municipalities and industries. The Colorado River begin its journey south of Lubbock as an intermittent stream. This means that there are periods where the riverbed goes dry and the flowrate is lower than measurable amounts. \n",
