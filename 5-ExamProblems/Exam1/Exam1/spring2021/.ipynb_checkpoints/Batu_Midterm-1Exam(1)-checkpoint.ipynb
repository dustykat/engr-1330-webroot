Now, in this task, you would like to know how many velocity values are greater than 11 meter/second.

For this, do a conditional selection on **ball_velocity_array** such that you pick velocity values that are greater than 11 meter/second and store it in a new variable name **ball_velocity_selection**.  Use **ball_velocity_selection** to find the number of velocity values that satisfied the condition and store it in a new variable name **ball_velocity_size**.
