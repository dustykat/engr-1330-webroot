    "### A. Illness-Based Absence Policy (Face-to-Face CLasses)\n",
    "If at any time during the semester you are ill, in the interest of your own health and safety as well as the health and safety of your instructors and classmates, you are encouraged not to attend face-to-face class meetings or events.  Please review the steps outlined below that you should follow to ensure your absence for illness will be excused.  These steps also apply to not participating in synchronous online class meetings if you feel too ill to do so and missing specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes because of illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are ill and think the symptoms might be COVID-19-related:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Call Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider.  During after-hours and on weekends, contact TTU COVID-19 Helpline at TBD.\n",
    "    2. Self-report as soon as possible using the Dean of Students COVID-19 webpage. This website has specific directions about how to upload documentation from a medical provider and what will happen if your illness renders you unable to participate in classes for more than one week.\n",
    "    3. If your illness is determined to be COVID-19-related, all remaining documentation and communication will be handled through the Office of the Dean of Students, including notification of your instructors of the time you may be absent from and may return to classes.\n",
    "    4. If your illness is determined not to be COVID-19-related, please follow steps 2.a-d below.\n",

    "    1. If your illness renders you unable to attend face-to-face classes, participate in synchronous online classes, or miss specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes, you are encouraged to contact either Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider.  Note that Student Health Services and your own and other health care providers may arrange virtual visits.\n",
    "    2. During the health provider visit, request a “return to school” note.\n",

    "Following the steps outlined above helps to keep your instructors informed about your absences and ensures your absence or missing an assignment due date because of illness will be marked excused.  You will still be responsible to complete within a week of returning to class any assignments, quizzes, or exams you miss because of illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Illness-Based Absence Policy (Telepresence CLasses)\n",
    "Same as above with respect potential to infect others; go to a health care provider if you are ill.

    "## Resources/Tools\n",
    "### Platforms for Python Programming (for your own computers)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anaconda platform (https://www.anaconda.com/): Anaconda distribution is an open-source Data Science Distribution Development Platform.  It includes Python 3 with over 1,500 data science packages making it easy to manage libraries and dependencies.  Available in Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Jupyter (https://jupyter.org/): JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: Configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. `note` Anaconda for MacOS includes a JupyterLab instance, so a separate install is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Modules for Python Programming\n",
    "3. Math module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html): Gives access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard e.g. factorial, gcd, exponential, logarithm. \n",
    "4. Operator module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html): Helps in exporting a set of efficient functions corresponding to the intrinsic operators of Python.  For example, the operator add(x,y) is equivalent to the expression x+y.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Modules for Data Science\n",
    "5. Scipy module (https://www.scipy.org/): A Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. Some of the core packages are:\n",
    "    * Numpy: Provides n-dimensional array package\n",
    "    * Scipy: Fundamental for scientific computing (e.g. linear algorithm, optimization)\n",
    "    * Matplotlib: Visualizations/2D plotting\n",
    "    * IPython: Enhanced interactive console <<= this is the kernel used in JupyterLab\n",
    "    * Pandas: Data structures and data analysis\n",
    "6. Scikit-learn module (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): A library for machine learning in Python. It is a simple and efficient tool for predictive data analysis.  It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some thoughts on \"your own machine\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have an Apple computer: The MacOS install is the easiest, and does a good job of installing everything - with a caveat! MacOS uses python 2.7+ as part of the OS (for upgrades and such), you have to be sure you are using the correct environment: `conda activate/deactivate` will become your friend. Do not buy an Apple computer for this course or any engineering course.  Apple makes a fine product, but professional engineering software is PC-centric.  Apple computers using a hypervisor are fine, but that's getting into complexity that will degrade the educational experience.  As a prediction, the first few years of Apple on ARM chips is going to be a disaster (for Apple) as most x86-64 application layers do not play well with ARM when the function calls are recursive -- but Apple will eventually work it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "My advice for WCOE students is to buy a PC if you can, even a cheap POS will serve you well at TTU.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A Windows 10 install is almost as easy, be sure you accept default paths of you will never get it to work right.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Linux install is the hardest of the three because of environment settings.  I found Ubuntu (Debian based, so same for Raspian) easier than CentOS (RHEL based).  Some things to remember, don't run conda as `sudo` it puts stuff in wrong place.  \n",
    "### On-Line Options\n",
    "While network dependent the https://cocalc.com/ environment is a good option, they have the kernels installed and running, you log-in and work on their servers.  The free tier is probabl;y more than adequate for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CECE Support Site\n",
    "The instructor maintains a web-site with a lot of useful content related to this course; nearly all the examples I will use in class will be stored at this site in addition to TTU-owned sites.  Feel free to visit and use the materials with attribution located at http://atomickitty.ddns.net/documents/JupyterOrion/\n",

Academic integrity is a personal choice to abide by the standards of intellectual honesty and responsibility.  Because education is a shared effort to achieve learning through the exchange of ideas, students, faculty, and staff have the collective responsibility to build mutual trust and respect.  Ethical behavior and independent thought are essential for the highest level of academic achievement, which then must be measured.  Academic achievement includes scholarship, teaching, and learning, all of which are shared endeavors.  Grades are a device used to quantify the successful accumulation of knowledge through learning.  Adhering to the standards of academic integrity ensures grades are earned honestly.  Academic integrity is the foundation upon which students, faculty, and staff build their educational and professional careers.

A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known to the instructor prior to the absence.  A student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence.  A student who is excused may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily.\n",
