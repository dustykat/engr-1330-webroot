    "The application of fundamental principles of modeling and mechanics often leads to an\n",

    "This subsection is an example in Python of implementing Newton's method with analytical derivatives.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The recipe itself is:\n",
    "1) Write the function in proper form, and code it into a computer.\n",
    "2) Write the derivative in proper form and code it into a computer.\n",
    "3) Make an initial guess of the solution (0 and 1 are always convenient guesses).\n",
    "4) Evaluate the function, evaluate the derivative, calculate their ratio.\n",
    "5) Subtract the ratio from the current guess and save the result as the update.\n",
    "6) Test for stopping:\n",
    "     i) Did the update stay the same value? Yes, then stop, probably have a solution.\n",
    "    ii) Is the function nearly zero?  Yes, then stop we probably have a solution.\n",
    "    iii) Have we tried too many updates? Yes, then stop the process is probably cycling, stop.\n",
    "7) If stopping is indicated proceed to next step, otherwise proceed back to step 4.\n",
    "8) Stopping indicated, report last update as the result (or report failure to find solution), and related information about the status of the numerical method.\n",
    "\n",

    "The following example illustrates these step as well as an ipython implementation of Newton's method.\n",
