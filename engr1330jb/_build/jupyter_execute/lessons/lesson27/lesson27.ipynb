    "Each team member should contribute.  Develop a communications plan (Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, ...) to arrange meetings to work on the project.  A team leader is responsible for the weekly report (it can be rotated) and the final products.  The team is responsible for identifying straphangers.  If you dont do anything, the rest of your team is supposed to rat you out so we can identify solo artists who are lousy teammates in future classes."
