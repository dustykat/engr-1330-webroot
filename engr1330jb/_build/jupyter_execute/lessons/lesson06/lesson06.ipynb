    "## What are Functions?\n",
    "Functions are simply pre-written code fragments that perform a certain task. In older procedural languages functions and subroutines are similar, but a function returns a value whereas a subroutine operates on data. The difference is subtle but important. \n",
    "\n",
    "More recent thinking has functions being able to operate on data (they always could) and the value returned may be simply an exit code. An analogy are the functions in *MS Excel*. To add numbers, we can use the sum(range) function and type `=sum(A1:A5)` instead of typing `=A1+A2+A3+A4+A5`\n",
    "\n",
    "To restate **A function is a block of code which only runs when it is \n",
    "called; it is pre-defined (prototyped) using parameters (placeholder variables)** \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. \n",
    "- A function can return derived data as a result, or just perform some operation\n",
    "- They are useful for decomposition; Functions are used to modularize a program. \n",
    "- The code blocks can be saved to a file, and imported in other scripts facilitating code reuse (i.e. pattern matching)\n",

    "## Calling the Function\n",
    "We call a function simply by typing the name of the function or by using a dot notation.\n",
    "Whether we can use the dot notation or not depends on how the function is written, whether it is part of a class, and how it is imported into a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions expect us to pass data to them to perform their tasks. \n",
    "These data are known as parameters( older terminology is arguments, or argument list) and we pass them to the function by enclosing their values in parenthesis ( ) separated by commas. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the `print()` function for displaying text on the screen is \"called\" by typing `print('Hello World')` where **print** is the name of the function and the literal (a string) 'Hello World' is the argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program Flow and Prototyping\n",
    "A function, whether built-in, or added must be defined *before* it is called, otherwise the script will fail.  Certain built-in functions \"self define\" upon start (such as `print()` and `type()` and we need not worry about those funtions).  The diagram below illustrates the requesite flow control for functions that need to be defined before use.\n",
