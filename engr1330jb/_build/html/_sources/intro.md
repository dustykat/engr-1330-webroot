# Welcome to ENGR 1330 (Cleveland)

This is a JupyterBook that is comprised of notes used by Dr. Cleveland in his sections.
Other instructors will have different content, so be sure to use the content specific to your section.

:::{note}
Here is a note! These play the same role as a footnote in paper-based documents.  They usually are to clarify contents, sometimes may just contain support codes

Below is a code block.  The JupyterBook is not interactive (yet!) but the code blocks will cut-and-paste and run in a Jupyter Notebook.:

```
e = mc^2

```
