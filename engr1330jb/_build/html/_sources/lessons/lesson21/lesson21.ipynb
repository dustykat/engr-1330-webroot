    "#### <font color=crimson>What is hypothesis testing ?</font><br>\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in making statistical decisions (about population) using experimental data (samples). Hypothesis Testing is basically an assumption that we make about the population parameter.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Example : You state \"on average, students in the class are taller than 5 ft and 4 inches\" or \"an average boy is taller than an average girl\" or \"a specific treatment is effective in treating COVID-19 patients\". <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We need some mathematical way support that whatever we are stating is true. \n",
    "We validate these hypotheses, basing our conclusion on random samples and empirical distributions."

    "Hypothesis testing is an essential procedure in experimentation. A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is supported by the sample data. When we say that a finding is **statistically significant**, it’s thanks to a hypothesis test."

    "### Background\n",
    "The Clean Water Act (CWA) prohibits storm water discharge from construction sites\n",
    "that disturb 5 or more acres, unless authorized by a National Pollutant Discharge\n",
    "Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Permittees must provide a site description,\n",
    "identify sources of contaminants that will affect storm water, identify appropriate\n",
    "measures to reduce pollutants in stormwater discharges, and implement these measures.\n",
    "The appropriate measures are further divided into four classes: erosion and\n",
    "sediment control, stabilization practices, structural practices, and storm water management.\n",
    "Collectively the site description and accompanying measures are known as\n",
    "the facility’s Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SW3P).\n",
    "The permit contains no specific performance measures for construction activities,\n",
    "but states that ”EPA anticipates that storm water management will be able to\n",
    "provide for the removal of at least 80% of the total suspended solids (TSS).” The\n",
    "rules also note ”TSS can be used as an indicator parameter to characterize the\n",
    "control of other pollutants, including heavy metals, oxygen demanding pollutants,\n",
    "and nutrients commonly found in stormwater discharges”; therefore, solids control is\n",
    "critical to the success of any SW3P.\n",
    "Although the NPDES permit requires SW3Ps to be in-place, it does not require\n",
    "any performance measures as to the effectiveness of the controls with respect to\n",
    "construction activities. The reason for the exclusion was to reduce costs associated\n",
    "with monitoring storm water discharges, but unfortunately the exclusion also makes\n",
    "it difficult for a permittee to assess the effectiveness of the controls implemented at\n",
    "their site. Assessing the effectiveness of controls will aid the permittee concerned\n",
    "with selecting the most cost effective SW3P.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement <br>\n",
    "The files precon.CSV and durcon.CSV contain observations of cumulative\n",
    "rainfall, total solids, and total suspended solids collected from a construction\n",
    "site on Nasa Road 1 in Harris County. <br>\n",
    "The data in the file precon.CSV was collected `before` construction began. The data in the file durcon.CSV were collected `during` the construction activity.<br>\n",
    "The first column is the date that the observation was made, the second column the total solids (by standard methods), the third column is is the total suspended solids (also by standard methods), and the last column is the cumulative rainfall for that storm.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "These data are not time series (there was sufficient time between site visits that you can safely assume each storm was independent.\n",
    "__Our task is to analyze these two data sets and decide if construction activities impact stormwater quality in terms of solids measures.__"
