    "The size of a matrix is referred to in terms of the number of rows and the number of columns. \n",
    "The enclosing parenthesis are optional above, but become meaningful when writing multiple matrices next to each other.\n",
    "The above matrix is 3 by 4.  \n",

    "When we are discussing matrices we will often refer to specific numbers in the matrix.\n",
    "To refer to a specific element of a matrix we refer to the row number (i) and the column number (j).\n",
    "We will often call a specific element of the matrix, the $a_{i,j}$ -th element of the matrix.\n",
    "For example $a_{2,3}$ element in the above matrix is 17.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in Python that we would refer to the element as $a_{matrix}[i][j]$ or whatever the name of the matrix is in the program; with the caveat that the elements start counting at 0. For instance in the matrix above $a_{matrix}[0][0]$ contains the value 1.\n",

    "A vector is really just a matrix with a single column, but are often treated as different kinds of entities.\n",
    "In python core, a matrix is simply a list of lists - each row is a list, and the matrix is a collection of rows.  A vector is simply a collection (list) of elements (we can force a vector to be a matrix, but we would have a structure that builds a collection of single element lists)\n",
    "\n",
    "For small matrices we can build them with explicit code; but larger ones are usually kept in files (hence the file handling lesson prior to this lesson).  Also processing matrices as lists is ultimately cumbersome, so we will later (*next lesson*) employ the `numpy` package that greatly facilitates matrix manipulation - here we will learn about matrix manipulation for the pedagogcal aspect.\n",
