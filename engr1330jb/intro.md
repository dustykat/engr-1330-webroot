The information below is of use to other potential institutional users of this book. 
**GitHub Repository**
This entire course (book, labs, and exercises) is contained in a public repository on GitHub [https://github.com/dustykat/engr-1330-webroot](https://github.com/dustykat/engr-1330-webroot)

>***How to Use***
>1. Clone the entire repository to /var/www/html/engr-1330-webroot.  Have your main index point to this directory i.e. `http://your-fqdn-server.org/engr-1330-webroot/` You can see working example at [http:/54.243.252.9/engr-1330-webroot/](http:/54.243.252.9/engr-1330-webroot/)
>2. If you plan to modify things, many of the internal links expect IP/hostname == `54.243.252.9`, so you will have to change these addresses to your server.  The string editor `sed` will become your friend!

- Materials herein come from many sources, in particular many from the Data8 repository from UC Berkeley, and many internet sources.  Sources in notebooks are at least cited by a URL.  As the content is matured, proper citations are to be inserted.
- The `3-Readings` directory contains copyrighted materials and should be exposed with care on a web server; generally because no one reads anymore, its probably safe enough to protect using `.htaccess` simple uid:pwd approach. In my courses we access things through the syllabus links, and the syllabus is accessed through our LMS (Blackboard)
