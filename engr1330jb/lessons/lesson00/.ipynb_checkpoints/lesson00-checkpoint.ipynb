    "\n",
    "*What is Data Science?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science enables businesses to process huge amounts of structured and unstructured big data to detect patterns. This in turn allows companies to increase efficiencies, manage costs, identify new market opportunities, and boost their market advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asking a personal assistant like Alexa or Siri for a recommendation demands data science. So does operating a self-driving car, using a search engine that provides useful results, or talking to a chatbot for customer service. These are all real-life applications for data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Science Definition*\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is the practice of mining large data sets of raw data, both structured and unstructured, to identify patterns and extract actionable insight from them. This is an interdisciplinary field, and the foundations of data science include statistics, inference, computer science, predictive analytics, machine learning algorithm development, and new technologies to gain insights from big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define data science and improve data science project management, consider its typical lifecycle as depicted in Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5deb974b5176872b2c106aba/5e3c3add630a1585791ff8a9_4dda7c5dc3564bce88dfa5114c53a774.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "<figcaption >Figure 1. Data Science Workflow</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first stage in the data science pipeline workflow involves capture: acquiring data, sometimes extracting it, and entering it into the system. The next stage is maintenance, which includes data warehousing, data cleansing, data processing, data staging, and data architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data processing follows, and constitutes one of the data science fundamentals. It is during data exploration and processing that data scientists stand apart from data engineers. This stage involves data mining, data classification and clustering, data modeling, and summarizing insights gleaned from the data—the processes that create effective data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next comes data analysis, an equally critical stage. Here data scientists conduct exploratory and confirmatory work, regression, predictive analysis, qualitative analysis, and text mining. This stage is why there is no such thing as cookie cutter data science—when it’s done properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the final stage, the data scientist communicates insights. This involves data visualization, data reporting, the use of various business intelligence tools, and assisting businesses, policymakers, and others in smarter decision making."

    "*Data Preparation and Exploration*\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation and exploratory data analysis are the most important data science skills, but data preparation alone typically consumes 60 to 70 percent of a data scientist’s time. Seldom is data generated in a corrected, structured, noiseless form. In this step, the data is transformed and readied for further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the process involves transformation and sampling of data, checking both the features and observations, and using statistical techniques to compensate for (remove) noise. This step also examines whether the various features in the data set are independent of each other, and whether there may be missing values in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exploration step is also a principal difference between data science and data analytics. Data science takes a macro view, aiming to formulate better questions about data to extract more insights and knowledge from it. Data analytics already has the questions, and takes a narrower view to find specific answers—not to explore."

    "Data Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data modeling step, data scientists build models of the data, often using machine learning algorithms. Model selection usually depends on the type of data and the business requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next the data model is tested to check its accuracy and other characteristics. This enables the data scientist to adjust the model to achieve the desired result. If the model isn't quite right for the requirements, the team can select any of a range of different data science models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once proper testing with good data produces the desired results for the business intelligence requirement, the model can be finalized and deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of a data model is to predict behavior from inputs that have not yet been observed.  These inputs may lie within the range of prior observations, and the model is providing interpolation-type predictions, or the inputs may lie outside the range of prior observations and the model is providing extrapolation-type predictions (which is more uncertain than interpolation)\n",
