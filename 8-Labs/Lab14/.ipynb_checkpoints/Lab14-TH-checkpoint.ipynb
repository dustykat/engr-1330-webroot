    "Most drugs have therapeutic benefits when the drug is above a “therapeutic threshold” but toxic side effects above a “toxic threshold”. Dosing protocols are intended to maintain the level of the drug in the patient’s blood within a “therapeutic window” that between these two thresholds. Using mathematical models helps an engineer optimize the drug design so the entire delivery process is as efficient as possible and localized drug concentrations are kept within a therapeutic window.  Here you will test some mathematical models for just one part of this process - an in vitro experiment of drug release from a nanoparticle. (“Nanosystems for Simultaneous Imaging and Drug Delivery to T Cells”, by Fahmy et al, AAPS Journal, 2007 vol 9.). The experimental results are listed below\n",
