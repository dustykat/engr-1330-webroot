Follow the steps and answer the questions. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step1: Read the \"CarsDF.csv\" file as a dataframe. Explore the dataframe and in a markdown cell briefly describe it in your own words. <br>\n",
    "- Step2: Calculate and compare the correlation coefficient of the \"selling price\" with all the other parameters (execpt for \"name\", of course!). In a markdown cell, explain the results and state which parameters have the strongest and weakest relationship with \"selling price\" of a vehicle. \n",
    "- Step3: Use linear regression modeling in primitive python and VISUALLY assess the quality of a linear fit with Age as the predictor, and selling price as outcome. Explain the result of this analysis in a markdown cell.\n",
    "- Step4: Use linear regression modeling with statsmodels and VISUALLY assess the quality of a linear fit with fuel economy as the predictor, and selling price as outcome. Explain the result of this analysis in a markdown cell.\n",
    "- Step5: Use linear regression modeling with statsmodels and VISUALLY assess the quality of a linear fit with engine volume as the predictor, and selling price as outcome. Explain the result of this analysis in a markdown cell.\n",
    "- Step6: In a markdown cell, explain which of the three predictors in steps 3,4, and 5, was a better predictor (resulted in a better fit ) for selling price?\n",
    "- Step7: Use multiple linear regression modeling with scikit-learn and use all the parameters (execpt for \"name\", of course!) to predict selling price. Then, use this model to predict the selling price of a car that has the following charactristics and decide whether this prediction is reliable in your opinion: \n",
