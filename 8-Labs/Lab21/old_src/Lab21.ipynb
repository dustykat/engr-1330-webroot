You ask around and you hear that he still can shoot a bullseye but as his hands shake, he sometimes misses by a lot. The second archer is Daryl. He is also a wellknown archer but unfortunately he has a drinking problem. You have understood that there has been cases that he has shot the bullseye in all of his three shots and there has been cases that he has completely missed the bullseye.

    "    We used the example above to give you an initial understanding of bias and variance and their impact on a model's performance. Given this is a complicated and yet important aspect of data modeling and machine learning, without getting into too much detail, we will discuss these concepts. Bias reflects how close the functional form of the model can get to the true relationship between the predictors and the outcome. Variance refers to the amount by which [the model] would change if we estimated it using a different training data set.  \n",

    "Looking at the picture above, Horace was an archer with high variance and low bias, while Daryl had high bias and low variability. In an ideal world, we want low bias and low variance which we cannot have. When there is a high bias error, it results in a very simplistic model that does not consider the variations very well. Since it does not learn the training data very well, it is called Underfitting. When the model has a high variance, it will still consider the noise as something to learn from. That is, the model learns the noise from the training data, hence when confronted with new (testing) data, it is unable to predict accurately based on it. Since in the case of high variance, the model learns too much from the training data, it is called overfitting. To summarise:\n",
    "    - A model with a high bias error underfits data and makes very simplistic assumptions on it\n",
    "    - A model with a high variance error overfits the data and learns too much from it\n",
    "    - A good model is where both Bias and Variance errors are balanced. The balance between the Bias error and the Variance error is the Bias-Variance Tradeoff.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The irreducible error is the error that we can not remove with our model, or with any model. The error is caused by elements outside our control, such as statistical noise in the observations. A model with low bias and high variance predicts points that are around the center generally, but pretty far away from each other (Horace). A model with high bias and low variance is pretty far away from the bull’s eye, but since the variance is low, the predicted points are closer to each other (Daryl). Bias and Variance play an important role in deciding which predictive model to use: Something that you will definitly learn more about if you go further in the field of machine learning and predicitve models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __How can we measure bias and variance?__\n",
    "    \n",
    "    There are GOF metrics that can measure the bias and variance of a model: For example the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient and the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE). The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency is calculated as one minus the ratio of the error variance of the modeled time-series divided by the variance of the observed time-series. In the situation of a perfect model with an estimation error variance equal to zero, the resulting Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency equals 1 (NSE = 1). KGE provides a diagnostically interesting decomposition of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (and hence MSE), which facilitates the analysis of the relative importance of its different components (correlation, bias and variability).   \n",
