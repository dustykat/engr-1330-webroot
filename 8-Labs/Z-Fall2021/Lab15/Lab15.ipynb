You can compare the mean and median as one way to detect outliers and asymmetry in your data. Whether the mean value or the median value is more useful to you depends on the context of your particular problem. The mean is a better choice when there are no extreme values that can affect it. It is a better summary because the information from every observation is included rather than median, which is just the middle value.
