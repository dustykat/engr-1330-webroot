A blue Pythonista, green behind the ears, went to Pythonia.
She wanted to visit the famous wise green Python snake.
She wanted to ask her about the white way to avoid the black.
The bright path to program in a yellow, green, or blue style.
The green Python turned red, when she addressed her.
The Pythonista turned yellow in turn.
After a long but not endless loop  the wise Python uttered: 
"The rainbow!"
