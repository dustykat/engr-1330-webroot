    "{numref}`speed-time-7-1` is a plot of some observations of speed and elapsed time. The graph includes a **title**, and the axes are **labeled** including the relevant **dimensions** and/or **units**.  The plotted points are shown on a contrasting background.  The points themselves are not connected by any guidelines, a convention used for plotting data in contrast to a data model, which would be plotted as a continuous line (curve).\n",
