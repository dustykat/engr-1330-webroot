    "Engineering analysis is a systematic process that leverages computational thinking paradigms (models) for analyzing and understanding problems in the various fields of engineering.  Sucessful application of the process requires familarity with generic problem-solving techniques, understanding of relevant engineering fundamentals that apply to the particular problem, and a working knowledge of computational thinking solution procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also helpful to have a computer-based computation environment where stored instructions (a program) can be implemented to solve the problem easily once the problem is defined and set-up.  In this course that environment is a Jupyter Notebook using the iPython kernel.  Collectively we refer to these jointly as our Jupyter Notebook."
