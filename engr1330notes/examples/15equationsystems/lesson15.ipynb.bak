In most water distribution systems the flow is usually turbulent so $\\alpha$ is assumed to be unity and the velocity head is simply $\\frac{V^2}{2g}$.\n",

    "### Pipe Networks Solution Methods\n",
    "Several methods are used to produce solutions (estimates of discharge, head loss, and pressure) in a network.  \n",

    "An early one, that only involves analysis of loops is the [Hardy-Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy_Cross_method) method. \n",
    "\n",
    "A later one, more efficient, is a [Newton-Raphson](http://54.243.252.9/ce-3372-webroot/3-Readings/NewtonRaphsonTheory/) method that uses node equations to balance discharges and demands, and loop equations to balance head losses.  The use of loop equations requires a technique to traverse loops, usually based on graph theory for directed graphs which can be quite complicated for large systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a rather ingenious method exists developed by [Hamam, Y.M., and Brameller, A. (1971)](http://54.243.252.9/ce-3372-webroot/3-Readings/HamamAndBrameller/), where the flow distribution and head values are determined simultaneously.  The task here is to  outline the  method on the problem below -- first some necessary definitions and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental procedure is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuity is written at nodes (node equations).\n",
    "- Energy loss (gain) is written along links (pipe equations).\n",
    "- The entire set of equations is solved simultaneously.\n",
