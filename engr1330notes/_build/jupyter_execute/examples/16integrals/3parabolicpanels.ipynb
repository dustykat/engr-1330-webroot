    "# Parabolic Panels\n",
    "Parabolic panels approximate the shape of the panel with a parabola.  The area between the chord and the curve (neglected in the trapezoidal solution) may be accounted for by approximating the function with a parabola passing through the points defined by three successive values of $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](para-panels.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This area may be calculated from the geometry of the parabola and added to the trapezoidal area of the pair of strips to give the area $\\Delta A$ of the pair as illustrated. Adding all of the $\\Delta A$s produces the tabulation shown, which is known as Simpson's rule. To use Simpson's rule, the number $n$ of strips must be even.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same example as presented for rectangular panels is repeated, except using parabolic panels.  The code is changed yet again because we will evaluate at each end of the panel as well as at an intermediate value."

This method is valuable because one can approximate convolution integrals quite effectively using quadrature routines, while the number of function evaluations for a polynomial based approximation could be hopeless.\n",
