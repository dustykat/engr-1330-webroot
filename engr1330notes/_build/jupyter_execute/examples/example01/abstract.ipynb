    "# Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recent past engineers learned complex mathematical procedures to find solutions (or good appriximations) to solve the varied equations involved in engineering calculations. Then these procedures were coded into a computer programming language (C, FORTRAN, ADA, and others), compiled, errors repaired and finally the actual problem addressed.  More recently spreadsheets (MS Excel, Borland (now Embarcadero) QuatroPro, Lotus 123, Libre Office Calc, and others) replaced a lot of this type of programming.  Even more recently Jupyter Notebooks enabled a technique called *Literate Programming* where narrative docomentation can be embedded within an executible document, and both the explaination and solution exist in a single tool.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lengthly calculations are comparatively easy to arrange and organize, and output can be extensively explained directly in the tool in a clear and logical fashion.\n",

    "This example presents a Jupyter Notebook that solves a common geopolitical problem, namely that of turning a capital city onto a smoking crater by a ballistic missle whose immediate post-boost phase velocity $v_o$ and angle relative to the Earth (treated as a plane) $\\Theta$ is known.\n",
