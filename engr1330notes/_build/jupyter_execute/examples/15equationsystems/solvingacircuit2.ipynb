    "## Step 3: List Known and Unknown Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Known:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Circuit topology (configuration) and component relative locations.\n",
    "- Source voltage: +12 volts as shown on the diagram.\n",
    "- Resistor values: $R_1=~10 \\Omega$ , $R_2=~5 \\Omega$ , $R_3=~20 \\Omega$\n",
    "\n",
    "Unknown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The current in different parts of the circuit: $i_0$ , $i_1$ , $i_2$ .\n",
    "- The voltage drops (differences) across each resistor: $V_1$ , $V_2$ , $V_3$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Identify Governing Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ohm's law:  The voltage drop across a resistor is the product of current frowing through the resistor and the resistance; $V=IR$ .\n",
    "- Kirchoff's Law - Resistors in Series; $R_T=R_1 + R_2 + \\dots+ R_n$\n",
    "- Kirchoff's Law - Resistors in Parallel; $R_T=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\dots+ \\frac{1}{R_n}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't actually need Kirchoff's Law in the method we will employ, mostly just Ohm's law and continunity of current at a node.  We will solve for voltages at each node, and currents in each link.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Different from the last time we examined this problem, we will simply write continunity of charge at each node:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum i_{inflow} - \\sum i_{outflow} = 0$ at each node (note if we have capicators and/or inductors, then there is a storage term and the system is no longer at equilibrium). So we will end up with one equation for each interior node (Node 0 and Node 7 have known voltages).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example for Node 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$i_0 - i_1 - i_4 = 0$ is the current balance equation for the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will implement Ohm's law for each link; for example for Link 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_1 - R_1 i_1 -V_5 = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next simply organize these into a system of equations and solve.  For this example the equation system looks like:\n",
