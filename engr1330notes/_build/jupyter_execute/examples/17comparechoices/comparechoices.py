# # Economic Modeling: Comparing Choices
# 
# Engineering design results in a potential investment opportunity for the sponsoring company.  The desirability of proposed designs is measured in both economic and technical terms - if several designs are proposed the desirability of one investment opportunity over another is strictly based on economic criteria (here we are assuming that the designs are technically feasible). 
# 
# Our computational tools provide a means to make such economic analysis and document our efforts; they also allow for the examination of complex investment patterns projected over future time periods.  
# 
# :::{note}
# Herein we simply present some fundamentals in engineering economic analysis.  Detailed examination is the subject of an entire semester course and outside the scope of this document.
