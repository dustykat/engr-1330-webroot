    "Engineering design results in a potential investment opportunity for the sponsoring company.  The desirability of proposed designs is measured in both economic and technical terms - if several designs are proposed the desirability of one investment opportunity over another is strictly based on economic criteria (here we are assuming that the designs are technically feasible). \n",
