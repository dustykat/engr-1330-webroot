    "The trapezoidal panels are approximated as shown in the figure below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](trap_panels.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The area $A_i$ is the average height $(y_i + y_{i+1} )/2$ times $\\Delta x$. Adding the areas gives the area approximation as tabulated.   For the example with the curvature shown, the approximation will be on the low side. For the reverse curvature, the approximation will be on the high side.  The trapezoidal approximation is commonly used with tabulated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script below illustrates the trapezoidal method for approximating an integral.  In the example, the left and right panel endpoints in $x$ are set as separate variables $x_{left}$ and $x_{right}$ and incremented by $\\Delta x$ as we step through the count-controlled repetition to accumulate the area.  The corresponding $y$ values are computed within the loop and averaged, then multiplied by $\\Delta x$ and added to the accumulator.  Finally the $x$ values are incremented --- for grins, we used the += operator on the accumulator\n"
