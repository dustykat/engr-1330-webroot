    "## Introduction: Pressure Transducer Calibration \n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement is a process of comparison: the measured quantity is compared to a known standard. Before we measure, we must establish the relationship between the readout val-ues of our instrument and known input values of the measurand. This process is called as calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of calibrating a system is to:\n",
    "- Relate the actual sensor output (i.e. a voltage) to the quantity we are attempting to measure ($\\frac{F}{A}$ a normal stress, we usually call pressure)\n",
    "- Identify and correct bias error\n",
    "- Quantify random error associated with using each system. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will develop scripts to calibrate two independent pressure measurement systems: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. an analog gauge and \n",
    "2. an electronic pressure transducer \n",
    "\n",
    "The pressures produced by the tester as shown by the values stamped on the weights as the exact true pressures. The true pressure, the pressure indicated on the analog gauge, and the voltage output by the pressure transducer are given to you, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows a picture of a typical deadweight tester instrument.\n",

    "## Objective(s):\n",
    "- Literature scan on instrument calibration and pressure measurement techniques\n",
    "- Analyse an existing measurement database and build a data model to calibrate a pressure transducer, and an analog gage.   The measurements database is comprised of 4 columns: \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A test ID (in practice replicate tests are conducted. Why?)<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The true applied pressures from 5 psig to 105 psig. <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The analog pressures read from the gauge.<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The voltages read from the transducer. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Build an interface to allow users to enter voltages and return an estimated pressure and an assessment of the uncertainty in the estimate, and return the anticipated analog reading.\n",
    "- Build an interface to allow users to add observations to the underlying database, and automatically update the calibration model to incorporate the new observations"
