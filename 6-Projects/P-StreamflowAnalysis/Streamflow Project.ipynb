    "## Case Study: The Colorado River in Texas\n",
    "\n",
    "The Colorado River is an approximately 862-mile (1,387 km) long river in the U.S. state of Texas. It is the 18th longest river in the United States and the longest river with both its source and its mouth within Texas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Colorado River originates south of Lubbock, on the Llano Estacado near Lamesa. It flows generally southeast out of the Llano Estacado and through the Texas Hill Country, then through several reservoirs including Lake J.B. Thomas, E.V. Spence Reservoir, and O.H. Ivie Lake. The river flows through several more reservoirs before reaching Austin, including Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson (commonly referred to as Lake LBJ), and Lake Travis. The Llano River joins the Colorado at Lake LBJ near Kingsland, and the Pedernales River joins at Lake Travis near Briarcliff. After passing through Austin, the Colorado River continues flowing southeast until emptying into Matagorda Bay on the Gulf of Mexico, near Matagorda. The Colorado is the largest river lying entirely within Texas; it drains an area of about 39,900 square miles (103,350 square km) and receives several forks of the Concho River, the Pecan Bayou, and the San Saba, Llano, and Pedernales rivers.\n",

    "\n",
    "The river is an important source of water for farming, cities, and electrical power production. In addition to power plants operating on each of the major lakes, waters of the Colorado are used for cooling the South Texas Nuclear Project near Bay City. Altogether, there are over 7,500 miles of creeks, streams, and rivers in our basin, and well over 2 million people live and work here. The Colorado’s watershed includes several major metropolitan areas, including Midland-Odessa, San Angelo, and Austin, and there are hundreds of smaller towns and communities as well. Many communities, like Austin, rely on the Colorado River for 100% of their municipal water. Because of its importance to the state’s economy, environment, industry, and agriculture it is recognized as the lifeblood of Texas.\n",
