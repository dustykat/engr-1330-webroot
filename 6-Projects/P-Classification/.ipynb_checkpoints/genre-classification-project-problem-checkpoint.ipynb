    "Our dataset is a table of songs, each with a name, an artist, and a genre.  For each song, we also know how frequently certain words occur in that song.  More precisely, we have a list of approximately 5000 words.  For each of these words, for each song, each item in the table describes the proportion of the song's lyrics that are the particular word.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the lyrics of \"In Your Eyes\" is 168 words long. The word \"like\" appears twice:  $\\frac{2}{168} \\approx 0.0119$ of the words in the song. Similarly, the word \"love\" appears 10 times: $\\frac{10}{168} \\approx 0.0595$ of the words. \n",

    "Our dataset doesn't contain all information about a song.  For example, it doesn't include the total number of words in each song, or information about the order of words in the song, let alone the melody, instruments, or rhythm. Nonetheless, you may find that word counts alone are sufficient to build an accurate genre classifier.\n",
