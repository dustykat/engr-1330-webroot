    "I could not think of a good name for this section - decisions perhaps? \n",
    "Anyway, this section is all about using conditions - logical expressions that evaluate as TRUE or FALSE and using\n",
    "these results to perform further operations based on these conditions.\n",
    "All flow control in a program depends on evaluating conditions. The program will proceed\n",
    "differently based on the outcome of one or more conditions - really sophisticated \"Artifical Intelligence\" pro-\n",
    "grams are a collection of conditions and correlations (albeit very complex). \n",
    "Amazon knowing what you kind of\n",
    "want is based on correlations of your past behavior compared to other peoples similar, but\n",
    "more recent behavior, and then it uses conditional statements to decide what item to offer\n",
    "you in your recommendation items. Its uncanny, but ultimately just a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparisons\n",
    "The most common conditional operation is comparison. If we wish to compare whether two\n",
    "variables are the same we use the ``==`` (double equal sign).\n",
    "For example ``x == y`` means the program will ask whether ``x`` and ``y`` have the same value. If\n",
    "they do, the result is ``TRUE`` if not then the result is `FALSE`.\n",
    "Other comparison signs are ``!=`` does NOT equal, ``<`` smaller than,`` >`` larger than, ``<=`` less than\n",
    "or equal, and ``>=`` greater than or equal.\n",
    "Like Excel there are also three logical operators when we want to build multiple compares\n",
    "(multiple conditioning); these are ``and``, ``or``, and ``not``.\n",
    "The ``and`` operator returns ``TRUE`` iff all conditions are ``TRUE``. For instance ``5 == 5 and 5\n",
    "< 6`` will return a ``TRUE`` because both conditions are true.\n",
    "The ``or`` operator returns ``TRUE`` if at least one condition is true. If all conditions are ``FALSE``,\n",
    "then it will return a ``FALSE``. For instance ``4 > 3 or 17 > 20 or 3 == 2`` will return TRUE\n",
    "because the first condition is true.\n",
    "The ``not`` operator returns ``TRUE`` if the condition after the ``not`` keyword is false. Think of it\n",
    "as a way to do a logic reversal.\n",
    "\n",
